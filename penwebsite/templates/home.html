        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
         Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
         when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
          It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
          remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
          containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
           including versions of Lorem Ipsum.A dip pen (or nib pen) consists of a metal nib with capillary channels, 
           like that of a fountain pen, mounted on a handle or holder, often made of wood. A dip pen usually has no ink 
           reservoir and must be repeatedly recharged with ink while drawing or writing. The dip pen has certain advantages
            over a fountain pen. It can use waterproof pigmented (particle-and-binder-based) inks, such as so-called India ink, 
            drawing ink, or acrylic inks, which would destroy a fountain pen by clogging, as well as the traditional iron gall ink,
             which can cause corrosion in a fountain pen. Dip pens are now mainly used in illustration, calligraphy, and comics.
              A particularly fine-pointed type of dip pen known as a crowquill is a favorite instrument of artists, such as David 
              Stone Martin and Jay Lynch, because its flexible metal point can create a variety of delicate lines, textures and tones
               with slight pressures while drawing.

        Stainless steel is a corrosion-resistant alloy of iron, chromium and, in some cases, nickel and other metals.
        Completely and infinitely recyclable, stainless steel is the “green material” par excellence. In fact,
        within the construction sector, its actual recovery rate is close to 100%. Stainless steel is also environmentally
         neutral and inert, and its longevity ensures it meets the needs of sustainable construction. Furthermore,
          it does not leach compounds that could modify its composition when in contact with elements like water.

        In addition to these environmental benefits, stainless steel is also aesthetically appealing, extremely hygienic,
         easy to maintain, highly durable and offers a wide variety of aspects. As a result, stainless steel can be found
          in many everyday objects. It also plays a prominent role in an array of industries, including energy, transportation,
           building, research, medicine, food and logistics.

            Plastics are a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials, that use polymers as a main ingredient.
             The plasticity during production makes it possible for plastic to be moulded, extruded or pressed into solid 
             objects of various shapes, making it an adaptable material for many different uses. This adaptability, plus a 
             wide range of beneficial properties, such as being light weight, durable and flexible, alongside cheap production
              processes has led to widespread adoption in contemporary society. Plastics typically are made through human industrial
               systems. Most modern plastics are derived from fossil fuel based petrochemicals like natural gas or petroleum; however,
                recent industrial methods use variants made from renewable materials such as derivatives of corn or cotton.

        <p id="ink-info">
            Ink is a gel, sol, or solution that contains at least one colourant, such as a dye or pigment, and is used to color a 
            surface to produce an image, text, or design. Ink is used for drawing or writing with a pen, brush, reed pen, or quill. 
            Thicker inks, in paste form, are used extensively in letterpress and lithographic printing.

Ink can be a complex medium, composed of solvents, pigments, dyes, resins, lubricants, solubilizers, surfactants, 
particulate matter, fluorescents, and other materials. The components of inks serve many purposes; the ink's carrier, colorants,
 and other additives affect the flow and thickness of the ink and its dry appearance.

In 2011, worldwide consumption of printing inks generated revenues of more than 20 billion US dollars. Demand by traditional 
print media is shrinking; on the other hand, more and more printing inks are consumed for packaging
